Before we analysis further and answer our questions, we first need have a glimpse of our datas.

What we have are the changes in the electricity generated by different energy sources(eg. biomass, nuclear, gas.) in our interested countries. Since electricity generation and consumption theoretically need to be balanced in real time, we can use generation data to approximate consumption data.


For example: we can get the daily distribution of energy usage in a day in Germany.

Of course, we can easily resample it according to the time frequency we want, eg. the monthly distribution in a year in Germany

<iframe src="./assets/images/Monthly.html" width="910" height="610" style="border: none;" scrolling="no"></iframe>

As we can see, in Germany, it seems that we use less energy in summer than winter.

Before we move on, one thing we need to mention is that nuclear,coal, oil, and gas are non-renewable energy while others(hydro, biomass, wind, and waste) are considered renewable energy sources.

After having a basic look at the distribution of usage of energy. We further explore the distribution of different source with the interventions. 
For example: Energy generation by Source in Spain with interventions.

### Electricity Generation Structure

Let's visualize the electricity generation structure amongs six countries before, during and after the epedemic respectively. 

Before we show you the visualization, let me introduce how we define before, during and after.

In our analysis, we define the "epidemic period" as the time frame beginning with the first confirmed case and extending until the point of return to normalcy((Spanish normalcy is missing, we took the average to fill it in)). This period encompasses the entire duration of the epidemic's impact, starting from its initial emergence and concluding when conditions have stabilized and daily life has resumed its usual rhythm. This definition allows for a comprehensive understanding of the epidemic's full scope and duration, capturing both the onset and the eventual subsiding of its effects.

To mitigate the impact of natural rhythms or seasonal fluctuations, we adopt a comparative approach in our data analysis. Specifically, for the periods before and after our focal "during" phase, we align the data based on the same months and days, but adjust the years, either by decreasing or increasing them by one year. This method allows us to closely mirror the temporal context of the "during" phase while effectively isolating and minimizing seasonal or cyclical variations. By comparing these analogous time periods across different years, we aim to gain a clearer understanding of any changes or trends that are not merely attributable to regular seasonal patterns.



<iframe src="./assets/images/Pie.html" width="1110" height="510" style="border: none;" scrolling="no"></iframe>

Based on pie chart, we can get some basic observations:
- The majority sources of most countries are nuclear, hydro, coal and gas.
- In most of counties, transition towards renewable sources increased during the epidemic, with higher hydro and coal and lower nuclear contributions except for the Serbia with higher coal and lower hydro contributions
- After the epidemic, most countries displayed a partial reversion in the renewable trend, notably in hydroelectric and gas power.
- Among all the countries, biomass, oil, and waste have made little contributions and remained relatively consistent.

These observations reflect the dynamic nature of energy consumption and production patterns in response to global events such as an epidemic. They also highlight the varying degrees of adaptability and resilience in different countries' energy sectors.

Let's conduct an analysis of variance (ANOVA) for these energy sources to assess whether there are statistically significant differences between them in terms of their effects or contributions. This analysis will help us determine if there are notable variations among these sources and which sources might significantly differ from the rest in their impact or significance.

<iframe src="./assets/images/ANOVA.html" width="810" height="610" style="border: none;" scrolling="no"></iframe>

The bar chart visualizes the -log10 transformed p-values from the ANOVA results for each energy source.
Red Dashed Line: This line represents the -log10 transformed significance level (typically p = 0.05). Bars that extend above this line are considered statistically significant.

Well, it is obvious that the key sources we mentioned previously are all in greater significance. So there might be some main factors that affect the trend of the key sources. 

What are they? Why the renewable sources experience fluctuations? Is it related to the lockdowns policy? Is it influenced by the mobility?

## The Ripple Effect of Interventions: Mobility and Energy Consumption during the Pandemic

### Data Glimpse
In order to answer these questions, we need to explore the mobility data: apple_mobility which contains the intensity score of the region in three transportation types(driving, walking and transit) of each day from 2020-01-13 to 2022-04-12. Please notice that the transit data of Serbia is missing.

The intensity score refer to relative mobility strength based on first day(2020-01-13, which intensity score is 100). The higher intensity score, the more people choosing the transportation types.

Review the data we all have now, mobility, intervention and energy generation. It is time to combine then together!


<iframe src="./assets/images/Total Electricity Generation_Mobility.html" width="1110" height="610" style="border: none;" scrolling="no"></iframe>


<iframe src="./assets/images/Renewable Generation Percent_Mobility.html" width="1110" height="510" style="border: none;" scrolling="no"></iframe>

At the onset of lockdowns, a sharp decline in mobility was observed across all countries. The once-bustling avenues of movement—captured in metrics of driving, walking, and transit—saw a sudden plunge. This drop in human activity was mirrored by a corresponding decrease in energy consumption. The graphs show a synchrony between the fall in mobility and a dip in energy usage, suggesting a direct correlation between the two.

While the reduction in mobility was somewhat uniform, the impact on energy consumption varied. In Finland, energy generation closely tracked reductions in mobility, indicating a direct dependency of energy usage on population movement. In contrast, countries like Germany displayed resilience in energy consumption despite decreased mobility, hinting at a robust energy infrastructure possibly catering to essential services that remained operational.

Gradually, as restrictions lifted, there was a cautious uptick in mobility. This return to movement, however, was not always matched by a proportional increase in energy consumption, suggesting a lasting change in energy use patterns, perhaps due to a sustained shift towards remote work and more conscious energy utilization.

While we've established a foundational perspective on how interventions influence mobility and energy consumption, to truly grasp the depth of these impacts, we require a more systematic assessment of the intervention strictness implemented by these countries. By quantifying the degrees of lockdown measures, we can disentangle the nuanced effects they have had on the day-to-day activities and energy usage patterns. This will enable us to paint a clearer picture of the relationship between policy strictness and its real-world repercussions

### Intensity of lockdowns

Thanks to the Oxford Covid-19 Government Response Tracker (OxCGRT), which furnishes extensive and scientific data about governments' diverse policy responses in 2020, 2021, and 2022. This data assesses the degree of governmental action on a scale. The resulting scores were combined to construct a series of policy indices, summarizing the collective impact of these measures.

According to the index calculation, we extract out relevant factors and then construct the `containment_index` (CI) representing the overall score of lockdown intensity.

We first have a glimpse on these countries on the mean of containment_index.

| Contries | CI(mean) |
|  :----:  | :----:  |
| Finland | 29.221927  |
| France  | 35.373300 |
| Germany  | 40.314003 |
| Netherlands | 38.458093 |
| Serbia  | 33.245152 |
| Spain  | 44.206023 |

Spain has the highest mean CI at 44.206023, suggesting that it implemented the most stringent lockdown measures among these countries. This might reflect a response to a severe outbreak or a proactive approach to prevent the spread of the virus.
Finland displays the lowest mean CI at 29.221927, which indicate that it had the least stringent lockdown measures. This could reflect a less restrictive approach to containment or a lower incidence of COVID-19 cases necessitating such measures.

Having observed the varying degrees of lockdown strictness, we now pivot our focus to a more granular exploration. 

### Correlation

Acknowledging the myriad of elements that could potentially affect energy consumption and its distribution, it becomes crucial to dissect and understand these intricacies. To achieve this, we are set to embark on a correlation analysis, complemented by an examination of p-values. This statistical approach will assist us in uncovering the degree to which these factors are related to energy consumption—whether they move in tandem or in opposition to each other. By deciphering the significance, directionality of these correlations, and the p-values, we can gauge the statistical significance of our findings. The inclusion of p-value analysis ensures that our conclusions are not just based on observed trends but are also statistically robust. This comprehensive analysis will illuminate how various influences interplay to shape energy usage patterns, particularly during the unique circumstances brought by the pandemic.

Let's analyze the result one by one.

Finland: A notable observation is the strong negative correlation between walking and total energy generation (-0.611). However, the p-value (0.935) suggests that this correlation is not statistically significant, which means we cannot confidently attribute changes in energy generation to changes in walking activity.

France: The negative correlation between renewable energy percentage and total energy generation (-0.351) is not statistically significant either, given its p-value (0.306). Thus, while there is an observed association, we cannot reliably infer a causal link between these variables.

Germany: The correlation between parks and total energy generation is slightly negative (-0.507), and the p-value (0.040) indicates that this correlation could be statistically significant. This suggests a potential inverse relationship between leisure activity and energy production, possibly worth further investigation.

The Netherlands: There's a strong negative correlation with the day of the week (-0.431), with a significant p-value (0.030), implying a consistent pattern where the day within the week might be influencing energy generation significantly, potentially reflecting operational cycles in energy usage.

Serbia: While there is a moderate negative correlation between grocery/pharmacy activity and energy generation (-0.362), the p-value (0.689) suggests that this correlation is not statistically significant.

Spain: A positive correlation with the year (0.379) suggests an increasing trend in energy generation over time, but the p-value (0.349) indicates that this trend is not statistically significant.

Across all countries, correlations vary in strength, but many lack statistical significance based on their p-values. This suggests that while some factors may appear to influence energy generation, these influences are not consistently strong enough to exclude the possibility that they are due to random chance.

With the insights from the correlation and significance analysis, we can now transition to predictive modeling using machine learning. The goal is to use the identified relationships that are both strong and statistically significant as features in our model. 
### Forecast by Machine Learning
Before we start, let us first introduce the datasets we use to do analysis and forecasting. Based on the correlation and p-value analysis 

`Total` representing the total electricity consumption as the label.

Based on the correlation and p-value analysis, we select out the following features.

`DayOfWeek` If this factor has consistently low p-values across multiple countries, it indicates a significant weekly pattern in energy generation that could be predictive regardless of the country. Energy consumption patterns can significantly differ between weekdays and weekends.

`Renewable_percent`: Even though the p-values vary, if the correlation is consistently strong across countries, this feature may capture the influence of renewable energy production on the total energy generation, which is a crucial aspect of modern energy systems.

`Parks`: If the recreational activity, as represented by the usage of parks, shows consistent correlations with energy generation, it might reflect broader societal behavior patterns that affect energy usage, such as reduced industrial activity on days with higher recreational activity.

`Transit Stations`: The use of transit stations could be a proxy for overall economic activity, including commuting patterns and industrial activity. If it correlates with energy generation across several countries, it could be a relevant predictor.

`CI (Containment Index)`: This could be a particularly relevant feature if the lockdown measures significantly impacted energy consumption patterns. The CI might capture the effects of reduced industrial, commercial, and personal activity on energy demand.

`Walking`: The activity level of the population, as indicated by walking, if correlated with energy generation, might reflect changes in daily routines that could impact energy consumption, such as increased remote work or shifts in commercial activity.

#### Split the train and test datasets

To ensure our model's reliability, we'll split the dataset into training and test sets. This division enables us to train the model on historical data and then assess its performance on unseen data, a crucial step before proceeding with analysis and forecasting.

Specifically, we select all the data from 2020 to 2021 as the training set while the test set contains data from ‘2022’ onwards. 


#### Model setup
Now that we've completed the preparatory work, let's proceed to train the model
- base_score=0.5: The initial prediction score of the model.
- booster='gbtree': Specifies the type of booster used, which in this case is a tree-based model.
- n_estimators=1500: The number of trees (estimators) to build in the boosting process.
- early_stopping_rounds=50: Determines the number of rounds (iterations) without improvement on the validation metric before stopping training.
- objective='reg:linear': The objective function set to linear regression, indicating the model will predict continuous numeric values.
- max_depth=4: Sets the maximum depth of the trees in the boosting process.
- learning_rate=0.01: Controls the step size at each iteration during training, preventing overfitting by making the model learning slower.



Utilizing the XGBoost library, we construct an XGBoostRegressor model, a highly regarded gradient boosting algorithm recognized for its proficiency in time series forecasting. Fitting the model involves training it on the provided dataset. Subsequently, we assess its performance on both the training and test sets by employing the root mean squared error (RMSE) metric.

#### Predictions


Now, it is time to utilize our trained model to make predictions on the test set and then create visualizations to represent the results.
<iframe src="./assets/images/Total Electricity Generation.html" width="1110" height="610" style="border: none;" scrolling="no"></iframe>

Well, from a direct visual standpoint, it hard to point out which country the model fits well since the y-axis scale is different, we need further information.

#### Evaluation

As data analysts, we can not rely solely on intuition. So let's take a look at their mean squared error scores(MSE).

| Contries | MSE |
|  :----:  | :----:  |
| Finland | 16.0547  |
| France  | 105.5828 |
| Germany  | 115.0548 |
| Netherlands | 30.0523 |
| Serbia  | 11.3036 |
| Spain  | 60.8878 |

As the result, we can find that the model performs excellently in Finland and Serbia while the model doesn't fit France and Germany well. However, in order to get more rigorous results, it is necessary to calculate their relative error(RE).

| Contries | RE |
|  :----:  | :----:  |
| Finland | 0.06640730145847717  |
| France  | 0.05783244011553519 |
| Germany  | 0.06171308332636071 |
| Netherlands | 0.0715750825149628 |
| Serbia  | 0.09554328979286301 |
| Spain  | 0.06836969529115823 |


Wow! As we see, their RE are very small, which indicates the model is performing fairly accurately.

Within this section, we conducted an analysis of total energy consumption utilizing the integrated dataset. This comprehensive analysis not only offers valuable insights into the patterns of total energy consumption but also facilitates precise forecasting. By comprehending the trends in total energy consumption, informed decisions can be made concerning energy management and resource allocation in the future public health issues.
