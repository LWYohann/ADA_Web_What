The bar chart visualizes the -log10 transformed p-values from the ANOVA results for each energy source: 

* Height of the Bars: The height of each bar represents the -log10 of the p-value for that energy source. Higher bars indicate more significant differences in the proportions of electricity generated from that source across the three periods (before, during, and after the pandemic).

* Red Dashed Line: This line represents the -log10 transformed significance level (typically p = 0.05). Bars that extend above this line are considered statistically significant.

## Mobility
